This is an example of how folium works and is scrap work to the eventual mapping portion I added to my python program. It reads a simple csv file 
with the help of a New Hampshire geojson graciously put out there: https://github.com/josephwarrick/geojson/blob/master/new-hampshire.geojson. Then the 
python program creates an html of a simple point given by the loco.csv and maps it in NH.
