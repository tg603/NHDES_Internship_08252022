# NHDES_Internship_08252022
This is a project I did for the New Hampshire's Department of Environmental Safety that entailed creating a scalping python script to take the JSON's given by the Purple Air API and making a CSV based on the values we wanted. Then it'd create an HTML map based on the current PM2.5 corrected data. Inside the python script lies an equation for wood smoke and flagging criteria that tells us and the program whether to keep/throw the data away. Included is the link for the currently adapted/hosted website based on my program and the html I created. I also went a few steps further and created an excel sheet called command that holds the macros of week7compiler and SingleDayAutoFormatter which are used to compile a single day's csv with rolling averages and the week7compiler includes a whole weeks worth of csv's.
