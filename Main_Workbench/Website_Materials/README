This folder includes all the website materials used on my version of the html map created by my python Pull.py script. The images are legends needed for 
PM2.5 data and the geojsons (aside from NH.geojson) were created by myself after hours of mapping coordinates with the help of https://www.latlong.net/. 
This was because I couldn't find all the counties geojsons anywhere; so I had to do them myself and I plan on releasing them for anyone else to use and save 
themselves the hassle of recreating these county geojson files for mapping.
